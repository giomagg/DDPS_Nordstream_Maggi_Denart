# Exploring the #NordStream Discourse on Twitter

_Paris, April 6th 2023_

This repository provides access to the code and the data used for the final project in the context of the course "Diving in the Digital Public Space" offered by CIVICA in the Spring of 2023 and taught by Prof. Jean-Philippe Cointet (_Sciences Po_), Prof. Marton Karsai (_Central European University_), and Armin Pournaki (_Sciences Po_). 

The project was developed by Giovanni Maggi and Louis Denart, master candidates in the Digital, New technologies and Public Policy specialisation of the _Sciences Po School of Public Affairs_. 

Here we present a summary of our findings. 

## Context of the Study

On September 26th 2022, at around 2am, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia to Germany underwent an explosion which resulted in the failure of the system. Around seven hours later, its sister pipeline Nord Stream 1 underwent the same problems. The two resulted in underwater gas leaks in the territorial waters of both Sweden and Denmark around the Bornholm Island (DK). The explosions were immediately recognised on September 27th as intentional sabotage by Sweden, Russia, the European Union (EU), and NATO. While there are evidence to indicate the intentionality of the explosions (found by the Swedish authorities and backed up by German Police investigations), there are no proofs concerning the identities of the perpetetrors, their motives, nor their means. Investigations are being carried on by Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and Russia.

The journalistic coverage of the events has also been 

The events come at a crucial point during the Ukrainian war which had already sparked tensions between the Russian Federation and the West (specifically with the EU) on crucial strategic infrastructure and on energy supply. Specifically interesting in this regard is the way in which the war already revived debates around European dependency on Russian natural gas supply – which at the time at the invasion made up the biggest share of gas imports for the EU **REFERENCE ISPI** – which the Krelin weaponised in response to the EU's actions following the invasion of Ukraine **REFERENCE**. Moreover, and interestingly enough, 

Against this background speculations have soared in the public sphere regarding the responsible actors for the sabotage. So far this has not resulted in any concluding evidence but has rather remained a game of pointing fingers. Officially, the Russian authorities have taken a strong position, and, on October 1st 2022, they blamed the United States in front of the UN Security Council to be behind the attack. Later on, on October 29th, the Russian Ministry of Defence pointed also to the United Kingdom as a possible perpetrator. Contrarily to Russia, the EU and NATO have yet to take an official positions – although suspicions of a Russian involvement in the sabotage dominated the public sphere in the Western media. Finally, as recently as March 7th, the US intelligence services released a report claiming that the attack was in fact caused by a pro-Ukrainian group.

In order to investigate this, we collected around half a mllion Tweets containing the #NordStream using Twitter API in english and in German starting from the day of the sabotage (29/09/2022) until the date of collection (12/03/2023).
