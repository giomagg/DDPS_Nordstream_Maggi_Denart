# Exploring the #NordStream Discourse on Twitter

_Paris, April 6th 2023_

This repository provides access to the code and the data used for the final project in the context of the course "Diving in the Digital Public Space" offered by CIVICA in the Spring of 2023 and taught by Prof. Jean-Philippe Cointet (_Sciences Po_), Prof. Marton Karsai (_Central European University_), and Armin Pournaki (_Sciences Po_). 

The project was developed by Giovanni Maggi and Louis Denart, master candidates in the Digital, New technologies and Public Policy specialisation of the _Sciences Po School of Public Affairs_. 

Here we present a summary of our study. 

## Context of the Study

On September 26th 2022, at around 2am, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia to Germany underwent an explosion which resulted in the failure of the system. Around seven hours later, its sister pipeline Nord Stream 1 underwent the same problems. The two resulted in underwater gas leaks in the territorial waters of both Sweden and Denmark around the Bornholm Island (DK). The explosions were immediately recognised on September 27th as intentional sabotage by Sweden, Russia, the European Union (EU), and NATO. While there are evidence to indicate the intentionality of the explosions (found by the Swedish authorities and backed up by German Police investigations), there are no proofs concerning the identities of the perpetetrors, their motives, nor their means. Investigations are being carried on by Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and Russia.

The journalistic coverage of the events has been debating the causes of the attack. On September 27th, the German news outlet [Der Tegesspiegel claimed](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wirtschaft/nord-stream-putin-spricht-von-terroranschlag-gegen-nord-stream-8687140.html) that the sabotaged had been the result of targeted attacks by submarines or divers. A couple of days later, on September 29th, [CNN reported](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/28/politics/nord-stream-pipeline-leak-russian-navy-ships/index.html) that Russian submarines were observed at the site of the sabotage in the days preceding the attack. Nevertheless, on November 11th, [Wired Magazine's analysis](https://www.wired.com/story/nord-stream-pipeline-explosion-dark-ships/) of satellite images suggested that two large unidentified ships – which turned off their tracking systems – were at the site of the sabotage in the days leading up the the events. Moreover, and highly relevant to this study, on February 8th 2023 the American 1970 Pulitzer-prize winner Seymour Hersh published an [article](https://seymourhersh.substack.com/p/how-america-took-out-the-nord-stream) on his personal blog on Substack claiming that the United States perpetrated the attack – and that it was aided by Nerwegian assets in doing so (see also [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/us-bombed-nord-stream-gas-pipelines-claims-investigative-journalist-seymour-hersh-s730dnnfz)' reporting on the article). 

The Nord Stream gas leaks come at a crucial point during the Ukrainian war which had already sparked tensions between the Russian Federation and the West (specifically with the EU) on crucial strategic infrastructure and on energy supply. Specifically interesting in this regard is the way in which the war already revived debates around European dependency on Russian natural gas supply – which at the time at the invasion made up the [biggest share of gas imports](https://www.ispionline.it/it/pubblicazione/gas-crisi-russia-ue-la-dashboard-con-tutti-i-numeri-35726) for the EU – which the Krelin weaponised in response to the EU's actions following the invasion of Ukraine (see [Boute 2022](https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0002930022000537/type/journal_article)). Moreover, further embedding Nord Stream in the context of the Ukrainian war, it is relevant to point out that, even before the invation, US preseident Joe Biden claimed he would have ["end[ed] Nord Stream"](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-germanys-scholz-stress-unified-front-against-any-russian-aggression-toward-2022-02-07/) in the case of a russian invasion.

Against this background speculations have soared in the public sphere regarding the responsible actors for the sabotage. So far this has not resulted in any concluding evidence but has rather remained a game of pointing fingers. Officially, the Russian authorities have taken a strong position, and, on October 1st 2022, they blamed in front of the UN Security Council the United States to be behind the attack. Later on, on October 29th, the Russian Ministry of Defence pointed also to the United Kingdom as a possible perpetrator. Contrarily to Russia, the EU and NATO have yet to take an official positions – although suspicions of a Russian involvement in the sabotage dominated the public sphere in the Western media. Finally, as recently as March 7th, the US intelligence services released a report claiming that the attack was in fact caused by a pro-Ukrainian group. 

## Methodology and Research Design

### Research Question 

Our research aims to explore how the game of pointing fingers is reflected in the Twitter debate. Specifically, because of the absence of concluding evidence from any of the investigations which have been carried on since the attack, and building on the highly heterogeneous public debate around the perpetrators of the sabotage, we ask:

> **To what extent are popular rumors about the perpetrator of the Nord Stream pipeline sabotage reflected in the Twitter discourse?**

### Hypotheses

Following from the brief qualitative work conducted in preparation to the study – which took into account the international press in order to understand the facts and speculations surrounding the Nord Stream sabotage – we developed three main hypothesis. These concern the topics which we expected to find in the Twitter discourse around the perpetrators of the attack.

Our first hypothesis is derived from the claims made by Russia both in front of the UN Security Council and on national television, as well as from the popularisation of such a narrative in the West following the publishing of Seymour Hersh's article. Moreover, analysing the [EUvDisinfo database](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?text=nord%20stream&date=), an initiative created by the EU External Action Services to track disinformation concerning the Ukrainian war, we found this narrative to be quite prevalent. Therefore, our first hypothesis is: 

> **H<sub> 1 </sub>: The prevalence of Tweets suspecting the United States behind the sabotage will be relatively high.**

Secondly, hypothesis number two is derived from the overall suspicion of Russia being behind the attack which has been quite prevalent in the journalistic discourse in many Western and European countries. This is mostly due to Russia's weaponisation of energy which culminated in the sabotage and often referred to Russia's . See for example: [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/28/politics/nord-stream-pipeline-leak-russian-navy-ships/index.html), [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-nord-stream-pipeline-could-be-behind-nord-stream-leaks-says-former-german-intel-chief/)'s reporting on Gerhard Schindler's declarations, or [The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/who-attacked-nord-stream-pipeline-russia-uk-west-ukraine-war-wv99ds7tx)'s summary of the different allegations. Nevertheless, no formal allegations have been put forward and the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/12/21/russia-nord-stream-explosions/) reported that, as of December, no concluding evidence were found to support this claim. Still, our second hypothesis is: 

> **H<sub> 2 </sub>: The prevalence of Tweets suspecting Russia behind the sabotage will be relatively high.**

Thirdly, we infer our third hypothesis mainly from the [US intelligence allegations](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-intelligence-suggests-pro-ukrainian-group-sabotaged-nord-stream-pipelines-nyt-2023-03-07/) reviewed by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/us/politics/nord-stream-pipeline-sabotage-ukraine.html). It is important to notice that [EU officials](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-officials-nord-stream-two-pipeline-allegation-ukraine-russia/) distanced themselves from such claims.

> **H<sub> 3 </sub>: The prevalence of Tweets suspecting Ukraine behind the sabotage will be relatively high.**

In addition, building the intuition that different communites discuss different topics, with different focuses and different interests – and thus develop different narratives around the same event – we developed a fourth hypothesis. 

> **H<sub> 4 </sub>: The degree of heterogeneity in the prevalence of popular rumors across different communities will be relatively high.**

We also expected the degree of heterogeneity to increase the futher we move away from a community in the retweet social network. What we mean by this is that if two communities are relatively close (i.e., they share many bridges relative to the number of nodes in each of them), then we can expect them to display similar topics while displaying subtle differences. On the other hand, if two communities are relatively distant (i.e., they do not share many bridges relative to the number of nodes in each of them), they will display more substantial differences in the topics and narratives present in each of them.

### Methodology

In order to investigate this, we collected around half a mllion Tweets containing the #NordStream using Twitter API in english and in German starting from the day of the sabotage (29/09/2022) until the date of collection (12/03/2023).

## Conclusion

Based on the exploratory analysis we conducted on the Twitter discourse around the Nord Stream sabotage, we can conclude that: 
- We find relatively high prevalence of Tweets suspecting the United States behind the sabotage
- Only a relatively small fraction of Tweets discusses Russia as a potential perpetrator
- Although a relatively high number of Tweets discuss the report about an alleged pro-Ukrainian group, it is mostly considered to be a distraction
- The degree of heterogeneity in the prevalence of popular rumors varies relatively greatly across the communities
