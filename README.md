# Exploring the #NordStream Discourse on Twitter

This repository provides access to the code and the data used for the final project in the context of the course "Diving in the Digital Public Space" offered by CIVICA in the Spring of 2023 and taught by Prof. Jean-Philippe Cointet (Sciences Po), Prof. Marton Karsai (Central European University), and Armin Pournaki (Sciences Po). 

The project was developed by Giovanni Maggi and Louis Denart, master candidates in the Digital, New technologies and Public Policy specialisation of the Sciences Po School of Public Affairs. 

Here we present a summary of our findings. 

## Context of the Study

On September 26th 2022, at around 2am, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia to Germany underwent an explosion which resulted in the failure of the system. Around seven hours later, its sister pipeline Nord Stream 1 underwent the same problems.

The events come at a crucial point during the Ukrainian war which had already sparked tensions between the Russian Federation and the West (specifically with the EU) on crucial strategic infrastructure and on energy supply.
